But it is a common believe that the symbol of modern\\ngame theory is the book of von Neumann and Morgenstern [33]. Modern game theory and modern control\\ntheory are like a twin. Not only because they were born in almost same time period, but also they have\\nsimilar purpose: to “manipulate” objects according to players’ purpose. Nowadays, more people try to\\nuse techniques in game theory to control problems, which are sometimes called game-based control, or\\ngame theoretic control [1, 3, 17, 32, 36, 38].\\nBayesian game is also called the incomplete information game. Comparing with complete information\\ngame, which is also called normal noncooperative game, Bayesian has more practical applications, because\\ngames with incomplete information, or uncertainty, are widely existing in real world, for instance [18]\\ngives some interesting examples such as Cournot competition under asymmetric information, ﬁrst-price,\\nsealed-bid auction, etc. Its various applications are investigated [26, 19, 13].\\nRecently, semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices has been used to study some problems in game\\ntheory. For instance, there are STP-based investigations for the evolution of dynamic games [20, 8],\\npotential games [7, 27], vector space structure of ﬁnite games [9, 21], and Boolean games [10], just to\\nmention a few.\\nPotential game was ﬁrstly proposed by [31], and then systematically developed in [30].\\nIt is of\\nparticular importance in game theoretic control [4]. Various problems about Bayesian potential games\\nhave also been investigated [12, 14, 15, 16].\\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for Bayesian game. Roughly speaking, the major\\ntechnique to deal with Bayesian game is to convert it into a normal game, which is also called complete\\n*Supported partly by NNSF 62073315 of China, and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation 2020TQ0184.\\n1\\n\\ninformation game. This method was ﬁrstly proposed by Harsanyi [22, 24, 25]. It is recently called the\\nHarsanyi transformation. Another commonly used transformation is Selten transformation [39]. Using\\nSTP, a very recent work proposed a new transformation, called Ex-ante agent transformation of Bayesian\\ngames, which keeps potential property unchanged [34].\\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 consists of some necessary preliminaries, including STP,\\nnormal noncooperative game, and potential game. Section 3 considers the matrix expression of static\\nBayesian game. In Section 4, two types fo Bayesian-Nash equilibriums are proposed. In Section 5, three\\nkinds of conversions from Bayesian game to normal game. Section 6 considers two kinds of Bayesian\\npotential games.\\nTheir veriﬁcations and some properties are presented.\\nIn Section 7, the dynamic\\nBayasian games are investigated. Particular interest has been put on some stratify updating rules, which\\nlead to Markovin dynamic equations. Section 8 is a brief conclusion.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\n2.1\\nSTP of matrices\\nThis subsection brieﬂy reviews STP of matrices.\\nDeﬁnition 2.1. [5, 6]: Let M ∈Mm×n, N ∈Mp×q, and t = lcm{n, p} be the least common multiple\\nof n and p. The semi-tensor product (STP) of M and N, denoted by M ⋉N, is deﬁned as\\n\\x00M ⊗It/n\\n\\x01 \\x00N ⊗It/p\\n\\x01\\n∈Mmt/n×qt/p,\\n(1)\\nwhere ⊗is the Kronecker product.\\nNote that when n = p, M ⋉N = MN. That is, the semi-tensor product is a generalization of con-\\nventional matrix product. Moreover, it keeps all the properties of conventional matrix product available\\n[6]. Hence we can omit the symbol ⋉. Throughout this paper the matrix product is assumed to be STP,\\nand the symbol ⋉is mostly omitted.\\nThe following are some basic properties:\\nProposition 2.2.\\n1. (Associative Law)\\n(F ⋉G) ⋉H = F ⋉(G ⋉H).\\n(2)\\n2. (Distributive Law)\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nF ⋉(aG ± bH) = aF ⋉G ± bF ⋉H,\\n(aF ± bG) ⋉H = aF ⋉H ± bG ⋉H,\\na, b ∈R.\\n(3)\\nProposition 2.3.\\n1. Let X ∈Rm, Y ∈Rn be two columns. Then\\nX ⋉Y = X ⊗Y.\\n(4)\\n2. Let ω ∈Rm, σ ∈Rn be two rows. Then\\nω ⋉σ = σ ⊗ω.\\n(5)\\n2\\n\\nThe following proposition shows that the STP satisﬁes the block-multiplication law.\\nProposition 2.4.

Then\\nA ⋉B =\\n\\x00Ci,j\\x01\\n,\\nwhere\\nCi,j =\\nq\\nX\\nk=1\\nAi,k ⋉Bk,j,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , p; j = 1, 2, · · · , r.\\nAbout the transpose, we have\\nProposition 2.5.\\n(A ⋉B)T = BT ⋉AT.\\n(6)\\nAbout the inverse, we have\\nProposition 2.6. Assume A and B are invertible, then\\n(A ⋉B)−1 = B−1 ⋉A−1.\\n(7)\\nThe following property is for STP only.\\nProposition 2.7. Let X ∈Rm be a column and M a matrix. Then\\nX ⋉M = (Im ⊗M) X.\\n(8)\\nLet m ≥1, n ≥1, and 1 ≤k ≤mn. Deﬁne\\njk := k(mod n);\\nik = (k −j)/n + 1.\\n(9)\\nDeﬁnition 2.8. [5] A matrix W[m,n] ∈Mmn×mn, deﬁned by\\nColk\\n\\x00W[m,n]\\n\\x01\\n:= δ(jk−1)m+i\\nmn\\n,\\nk = 1, · · · , mn,\\n(10)\\nis called the (m, n)-th dimensional swap matrix.\\nThe basic function of the swap matrix is to “swap” two vectors. That is,\\n3\\n\\nProposition 2.9. Let X ∈Rm and Y ∈Rn be two columns. Then\\nW[m,n] ⋉X ⋉Y = Y ⋉X.\\n(11)\\nDeﬁne a matrix PRn ∈Ln2×n, called the order reducing matrix, as\\nColi(PRn) = δ(i−1)n+i\\nn2\\n,\\ni = 1, · · · , n.\\n(12)\\nDeﬁnition 2.10. Let A ∈Mp×n and B ∈Mq×n. Then the Khatri-Rao Product of A and B is\\nA ∗B = [Col1(A) ⋉Col1(B), · · · , Coln(A) ⋉Coln(B)] ∈Mpq×n.\\n(13)\\n2.2\\nNormal Non-cooperative Game\\nDeﬁnition 2.11. A (ﬁnite non-cooperative) normal game is described as a triple G = (N, S, C), where\\n(i) N = {1, 2, · · · , n} is the set of players;\\n(ii) S = Qn\\ni=1 Si is called the proﬁle, with\\nSi = {si\\n1, si\\n2, · · · , si\\nki},\\ni = 1, · · · , n,\\n(14)\\nthe set of strategies of player i, and S−i := Qn\\nj̸=i Sj;\\n(iii) C = (c1, · · · , cn) ∈Rn with ci : S →R deﬁned as\\nci := ci(s1, · · · , sn),\\nsj ∈Sj, j = 1, · · · , n,\\ni = 1, · · · , n,\\n(15)\\nis called the payoﬀfunction of player i.\\nDenote the structure vector of ci by V c\\ni , i = 1, · · · , n. Assume |N| = n and ki, i = 1, · · · , n are\\nﬁxed, we denote the set of such games by G[n;k1,··· ,kn]. Note that if G ∈G[n;k1,··· ,kn], then G is uniquely\\ndetermined by {V c\\ni\\n\\x0c\\x0c i = 1, · · · , n}. Hence,\\nG[n;k1,··· ,kn] ≃Rnκ,\\n(16)\\nwhere κ = Qn\\ni=1 ki.\\nDeﬁnition 2.12. G ∈G[n;k1,··· ,kn] is expressed as VG = (V c\\n1 , · · · , V c\\nn) ∈Rnκ, where V c\\ni is the structure\\nvector of ci of G, i = 1, · · · , n.\\nRemark 2.13. The decision-making (or strategy-selection of each player j) is based on the diﬀerence of\\ncj over two diﬀerent strategy proﬁles\\ncj(s) −cj(s′),\\nj = 1, · · · , n; s, s′ ∈S.\\nFor instance, the following concepts are depending on such diﬀerences:\\n(i) A strategy proﬁle s∗= (s∗\\n1, · · · , s∗\\nn) is a Nash equilibrium if\\nci(s∗\\ni , s∗\\n−i) ≥ci(si, s∗\\n−i),\\n∀si ∈Si, s∗\\n−i ∈S−i, i = 1, · · · , n.\\n(17)\\nIt is easy to verify that Nash equilibrium depends on {cj(s) −cj(s′)\\n\\x0c\\x0c j = 1, · · · , n} only.\\n4\\n\\n(ii) In the deﬁnition of potential games [30] it is assumed that there is a pseudo-mixed-logical function\\nP : Qn\\ni=1 Dki →R such that\\nci(xi, s−i) −ci(yi, s−i) = P(xi, s−i) −P(yi, s−i),\\ni = 1, · · · , n.\\nIt is clear that whether a game is potential depends on {cj(s) −cj(s′)\\n\\x0c\\x0c j = 1, · · · , n} only.\\n(iii) Consider an evolutionary game, two of the most commonly used strategy updating rules (SURs) are\\nthe better and best response dynamics [11].\\n• Better response SUR: updating its strategy to a strategy in {si\\n\\x0c\\x0c ci(si, s−i(t)) > ci(s(t))},\\nchosen uniformly at random;\\n• Best response SUR: updating its strategy to a strategy in argmaxsi ci(si, s−i(t)), chosen uni-\\nformly at random;\\nOne sees easily that they depend on {cj(s) −cj(s′)\\n\\x0c\\x0c j = 1, · · · , n} only.\\nThe following proposition is obvious.\\nProposition 2.14. Two games G and G′ are equivalent (for decision making) if there exists a row vector\\nv ∈Rκ such that\\nV c\\ni + v = V c′\\ni ,\\ni = 1, · · · , n.\\n(18)\\nFrom Proposition 2.14 one sees easy that a game (precisely, an equivalent class of games) can be\\nexpressed as\\nWG := [V c\\n2 −V c\\n1 , V c\\n3 −V c\\n1 , · · · , V c\\nn −V c\\n1 ].\\n(19)\\nWe call (19) the equivalent vector form of G.\\nUsing equivalent vector form of G, one sees that G[n;k1,··· ,kn] is an (n −1)κ dimensional vector space.\\nThat is,\\nG[n;k1,··· ,kn] ∼R(n−1)κ.\\n(20)\\n2.3\\nPotential Game\\nDeﬁnition 2.15. [30] Consider a ﬁnite game G ∈G[n;k1,··· ,kn]. If there is a function P : S →R, such\\nthat for every i ∈N and for every s−i ∈S−i\\nci(x, s−i) −ci(y, s−i) = P(x, s−i) −P(y, s−i),\\ni = 1, · · · , n,\\n(21)\\nthen G is called an exact potential game.\\nThe followings are some fundamental properties of potential.\\nTheorem 2.16. [30] If G is a potential game, then the potential function P is unique up to a constant\\nnumber. Precisely, if P1 and P2 are two potential functions, then P1 −P2 = c0 ∈R.\\n5\\n\\nTheorem 2.17. [30] Let P be a potential function for G. Then s ∈S is an equilibrium point of G, if\\nand only if\\nP(s) ≥P(s−i, x),\\n∀x ∈Si, i = 1, · · · , n.\\n(22)\\nParticularly, if P admits a maximal value in S, then G has at least one pure Nash equilibrium.\\nCorollary 2.18. Every ﬁnite potential game possesses a pure Nash equilibrium.\\nThe following argument is a generalization of potential equation [7].\\nAssume G ∈G[n;k1,··· ,kn] is potential, deﬁne\\ndi(s1, · · · , sn) := ci(s1, · · · , sn) −P(s1, · · · , sn),\\ni = 1, · · · , n.\\n(23)\\nThen it is easy to verify that di is independent of si, denoted by di = di(s1, · · · , ˆsi, · · · , sn). In vector\\nform (23) becomes\\nV d\\ni ⋉j̸=i sj = V c\\ni s −V P s,\\ni = 1, · · · , n.\\n(24)\\nwhere s = ⋉n\\nj=1sj.\\nDeﬁne\\nEi := Iαi ⊗1T\\nki ⊗Iβi,\\ni = 1, · · · , n,\\nwhere\\nα1 = 1,\\nαi = Qi−1\\nj=1 kj, j ≥2\\nβn = 1,\\nβi = Qn\\nj=i+1 kj, j ≤n −1.\\nThen (24) can be expressed as\\nV d\\ni Ei = V c\\ni −V p,\\ni = 1, · · · , n.\\n(25)\\nSolving the ﬁrst equation to get\\nV P = V c\\n1 −V d\\n1 E1,\\nand plugging it into the other equations of (25) yield\\nV d\\ni Ei = V d\\n1 E1 = V c\\ni −V c\\n1 ,\\ni = 2, 3, · · · , n.\\n(26)\\nDenote\\nξi = (V d\\ni )T ,\\ni = 1, · · · , n;\\nb := W T\\nG.\\n(27)\\nThen (26) can be expressed as\\nΨξ = b,\\n(28)\\nwhere ξ = (ξT\\n1 , · · · , ξT\\nn )T and\\nΨ =\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\n−ET\\n1\\nET\\n2\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n−ET\\n1\\n0\\nET\\n3\\n· · ·\\n0\\n...\\n−ET\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n· · ·\\nET\\nn .\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fa\\uf8fa\\uf8fa\\uf8fb\\n(29)\\nSummarizing the above argument, we have\\n6\\n\\nTheorem 2.19. [9] Let G ∈G[n,k1,··· ,kn].\\nG is a potential game, if and only if (28) has solution.\\nMoreover, when a solution exists, then\\nV P = V c\\n1 −ξT\\n1 E1.\\n(30)\\n3\\nStatic Bayesian Game\\nDeﬁnition 3.1. [18] A (ﬁnite) static Bayesian game (BG) G = (N, T, A, c, Pr) consists of\\n(i) Player set:\\nN = {1, 2, · · · , n}.\\n(31)\\n(ii) Type set:\\nT = T1 × T2 × · · · × Tn,\\n(32)\\nwhere Ti is the type set of player i with\\nTi = {t1\\ni , t2\\ni , · · · , tτi\\ni },\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , n.\\n(33)\\n(iii) Proﬁle and actions:\\nA = A1 × A2 × · · · × An,\\n(34)\\nwhere Ai is the action set of player i with\\nAi =\\n\\x08\\na1\\ni , a2\\ni , · · · , ari\\ni\\n\\t\\n,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , n,\\n(35)\\nand Ai(tj\\ni) is the admissible actions under type tj\\ni with\\nAi(tj\\ni) ⊂Ai,\\nj = 1, 2, · · · , τi, i = 1, · · · , n.\\n(36)\\n(iv) Payoﬀfunctions:\\nci : A1(tj1\\n1 ) × A2(tj2\\n2 ) × · · · × An(tjn\\nn ) →R,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , n.\\n(37)\\n(v) Beliefs:\\npi (t−i | ti) = Pr(t1, t2, · · · , tn)\\nPr(ti)\\n=\\nPr(ti, t−i)\\nP\\nt′\\n−i\\nPr(ti, t′\\n−i),\\n(38)\\nwhere t−i ∈T−i := Q\\nj̸=i Tj. Pr(t1, t2, · · · , tn), called the common prior, is a common knowledge,\\nand ti is a private knowledge for player i.\\n7\\n\\nIdentify i ∼δi\\nl ∈Dl, then δi\\nl is called the vector representation of integer i. By virtue of vector\\nrepresentation of actions and types, then the action set Ai and type set Ti can be expressed as\\nAi =\\n\\x08\\nδj\\nri | 1 ≤j ≤ri\\n\\t\\n; Ti =\\n\\x08\\nδj\\nτi | 1 ≤j ≤τi\\n\\t\\n,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , n.\\nDenote by r = Qn\\ni=1 ri, τ = Qn\\ni=1 τi, R−∞= R ∪{−∞}, and\\n¯ci(a1, · · · , an; t1, · · · , tn) =\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nci(a1, · · · , an; t1, · · · , tn),\\naj ∈Aj(tj),\\n−∞,\\notherwise,\\n1 ≤i ≤n.\\n(39)\\nThen we have\\n¯ci : ∆rτ →R−∞,\\n1 ≤i ≤n.\\n(40)\\nUsing (39), it is obvious that for each i there exists a unique row vector Vi ∈Rrτ\\n−∞such that\\n¯ci(a1, · · · , an; t1, · · · , tn) = V ¯c\\ni ta,\\n1 ≤i ≤n,\\n(41)\\nwhere a = ⋉n\\ni=1ai, t = ⋉n\\ni=1ti. Let VG := [V ¯c\\n1 , · · · , V ¯c\\nn], which is called the structure vector of Bayesian\\ngame G.\\nRemark 3.2.\\n(i) Here we assume the purpose of each player is to maximize his payment.

De-\\nnote by P(a; a′) the probability transferring from proﬁle a to a′ under the dynamics of asynchronous\\nLR. To prove µT (a) is an invariant distribution, we only need to prove that the following detailed\\nbalance condition is satisﬁed\\nµT (a)P(a; a′) = µT (a′)P(a′; a),\\n∀a, a′ ∈A.\\nIf a = a′, the detailed balance condition is clearly fulﬁlled. If a and a′ diﬀer in more than one\\nplayer, then P(a; a′) = P(a′; a) = 0. Hence we only consider that a and a′ diﬀer exactly in one\\nplayer i. That is, ai ̸= a′\\ni, a−i = a′\\n−i.

The proof to asynchronous S-MBAR is the same, so we omit the details.\\n✷\\nSimilarly, we can design asynchronous concurrent LR (C-LR) and separate LR (S-LR) for Action-Type\\nBayesian games, which are shown as follows:\\n31\\n\\n(i) The SUR is called asynchronous C-LR, if at time k the updating player i chooses his action and\\ntype concurrently according to the following probability\\nPr\\n\\x00ai(k + 1) = ai, ti(k + 1) = ti|a(k), ti(k)\\n\\x01\\n=\\ne\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(ai,ti,a−i(k))\\nP\\n(a′\\ni,t′\\ni)∈Ai×Ti e\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(a′\\ni,t′\\ni,a−i(k)) ,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , n.\\n(86)\\n(ii) The SUR is called asynchronous S-LR, if at time k the updating player i either chooses his action\\naccording to the following probability\\nPr\\n\\x00ai(k + 1) = ai|a(k), ti(k)\\n\\x01\\n=\\ne\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(ai,ti(k),a−i(k))\\nP\\na′\\ni∈Ai e\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(a′\\ni,ti(k),a−i(k)) ,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , n.\\n(87)\\nor chooses his type according to the following probability\\nPr\\n\\x00ti(k + 1) = ti|a(k), ti(k)\\n\\x01\\n=\\ne\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(ti,ai(k),a−i(k))\\nP\\nt′\\ni∈Ti e\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(t′\\ni,ai(k),a−i(k)) ,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , n.\\n(88)\\nTheorem 7.7. Consider an Action-Type Bayesian potential game G = (N, A, T, c, Pr). Suppose each\\nplayer updates his action according to asynchronous C-LR or S-LR. Then\\n(i) The invariant distribution, denote by νT , of asynchronous LR (either C-LR or S-LR) is\\nνT (a, t) =\\ne\\n1\\nT QAT (a,t)\\nP\\n(a′,t′)∈A×T e\\n1\\nT QAT (a′,t′) .\\n(89)\\n(ii) Let ν0(a, t) = limT →0 νT (a, t). Then the support of ν0 is equal to the set of maximizers of potential\\nfunction QAT(a, t).\\nProof: We only prove (i), because the proof of (ii) is similar to the proof of Theorem 7.4.\\nThe asynchronous C-LR deﬁnes an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain on the state space A × T .\\nDenote by P(a, t; a′, t′) the probability transferring from proﬁle (a, t) to (a′, t′) under the dynamics of\\nasynchronous C-LR. To prove νT (a, t) is an invariant distribution, we only need to prove that the following\\ndetailed balance condition is satisﬁed\\nνT (a, t)P(a, t; a′, t′) = νT (a′)P(a′, t′; a, t),\\n∀a, a′ ∈A, t, t′ ∈T.\\nIf a = a′, t = t′, the detailed balance condition is clearly fulﬁlled. If a, a′ or t, t′ diﬀer in more than\\none player, then P(a, t; a′, t′) = P(a′, t′; a, t) = 0. Hence we only consider that a, a′ or t, t′ diﬀer exactly\\nin one player i. That is, ai ̸= a′\\ni, a−i = a′\\n−i; ti ̸= t′\\ni, t−i = t′\\n−i. Then,\\nνT (a, t)P(a, t; a′, t′)\\n=\\ne\\n1\\nT QAT (a,t)\\nP\\n(¯a,¯t)∈A×T e\\n1\\nT QAT (¯a,¯t) ·\\ne\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(a′\\ni,a−i,t′\\ni)\\nP\\n(˜ai,˜ti)∈Ai×Ti e\\n1\\nT cAT\\ni\\n(˜ai,˜ti,a−i)\\n=\\ne\\n1\\nT QAT (a,t)\\nP\\n(¯a,¯t)∈A×T e\\n1\\nT QAT (¯a,¯t) ·\\ne\\n1\\nT QAT (a′\\ni,a−i,t′\\ni,t−i)\\nP\\n(˜ai,˜ti)∈Ai×Ti e\\n1\\nT QAT (˜ai,˜ti,a−i,t−i)\\n=\\ne\\n1\\nT QAT (a′\\ni,a−i,t′\\ni,t−i)\\nP\\n(¯a,¯t)∈A×T e\\n1\\nT QAT (¯a,¯t) ·\\ne\\n1\\nT QAT (a,t)\\nP\\n(˜ai,˜ti)∈Ai×Ti e\\n1\\nT QAT (˜ai,˜ti,a−i,t−i)\\n=\\nνT (a′, t′)P(a′, t′; a, t).\\n32\\n\\nThe proof for asynchronous S-LR is the same, so it is omitted.\\n✷\\nWe give an example to show how to get the dynamic equation for repeated Bayesian game under\\nAT-Conversion.\\nExample 7.8. Recall the Bayesian game G = (N, A, T, c, Pr) in Example 6.11. Suppose\\nα1 = −1,\\nα2 = 3,\\nα3 = −4,\\nα4 = 2,\\nα5 = −1,\\nα6 = 5,\\nα7 = 1,\\nα8 = 2;\\nβ1 = 7,\\nβ2 = 5,\\nβ3 = 6,\\nβ4 = 4,\\nβ5 = −2,\\nβ6 = 3,\\nβ7 = 1,\\nβ8 = 2.\\nAccording to Example 6.11, G is Action-Type potential.\\nAssume the SUR is asynchronous C-MBRA, player 1 updates his action and type ﬁrst and then player\\n2 updates his action and type. It is easy to get the dynamic equation as\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nt1(2k + 1)a1(2k + 1) = δ4[4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]t1(2k)a(2k),\\nt2(2k + 1)a2(2k + 1) = t2(2k)a(2k),\\nk = 1, 2, · · · ,\\nand\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nt2(2k)a2(2k) = δ4[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]t2(2k −1)a(2k −1),\\nt1(2k)a1(2k) = t1(2k −1)a(2k −1),\\nk = 1, 2, · · · .\\nDenote by x(k) := t(k) ⋉a(k). It is obvious that the ﬁxed points of asynchronous C-MBRA dynamics\\nare\\nxf\\n1 = (t2\\n1, t1\\n2, a1\\n1, a1\\n2),\\nxf\\n2 = (t2\\n1, t1\\n2, a2\\n1, a1\\n2).\\nWe can verify that both xf\\n1 and xf\\n2 are the AT-BN-E of G.\\n8\\nConclusion\\nThe main purpose of this paper is to provide a fundamental framework for ﬁnite Bayesian games, using\\nSTP expression of ﬁnite games.\\nThree conversions from incomplete information to complete information are discussed, which are\\nHarsanyi, Selten, and AT conversions respectively. Formulas are obtained for three conventions respec-\\ntively. In addition, Bayesian potential game is also investigated. Finally, the evolutive equations for\\ndynamic Bayesian games are also provided according to SURs and conversions.\\nThere are many problems remain for further investigation.\\nFor instance, the following are some\\nchallenging topics:\\n(i) A generalization: State-based game. (As time-varying types.)\\n(ii) Deal with all history based knowledge SUR. (Truncation)\\n(iii) Learning-based optimization.\\n(iv) Calculating Bayesian Nash equilibrium.\\n(v) Dynamic Bayesian Nash equilibrium.\\n(vi) Application of Potential Bayesian game.\\n33\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] M.
